# Why this readme exists
* Due to lack of time (focusing on the group project mostly) 
* and studying up on graph theory for my solver,
* I submitted this project so that it passes unittests
* However, if you want to play the actual game and see my mazerunner in action,
* follow these steps:

## To run my maze (hungry joker maze):
* run `python3 robot.py turtle hungry_joker_maze`

_Note_ : **BEFORE** running maze, please go to world.turtle.world module, find -- generate_obstacles function -- change jimmy.fd to (20) instead of (4) and jimmy.lt to jimmy.rt

## Thank you - You can only start mazerun when in the middle, and you can also face any direction
