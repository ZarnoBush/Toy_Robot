## To run my maze (the crazy maze):
* run `python3 robot.py turtle the_crazy_maze`

_Note_ : **BEFORE** running maze, please go to world.turtle.world module, find -- generate_obstacles function -- change bush.fd to (20) instead of (4) and bush.lt to bush.rt

## Thank you - You can only start mazerun when in the middle, and you can also face any direction
